# Business Create UI

## How to build the openshift environment

### Images
This repo has implemented github actions to build and push the new image into our *tools* environment in OpenShift when a PR is merged. The significance in the OpenShift environment is there's no need for a build config or build pipeline.

You will still need to build the image stream (`oc create imagestream <name>`) and create tags for *dev, test, test-previous, prod and prod-previous* (`oc tag <namespace-tools>/<image name>:<source> <namespace-tools>/<image name>:<destination>`)

### Deployment Objects
There are 5 objects you need to create in OpenShift for the UI to run: deployment config, service, route, config map and keycloak config map. By updating the param file values in *bcrs-business-create-ui.dc-srvc-rt-cmap.param* to what you need for the OpenShift environment and running `oc process -f templates/business-create-ui.dc-srvc-rt-cmap-kcmap.json --param-file=business-create-ui.dc-srvc-rt-cmap-kcmap.param  | oc create -f -` you will create all 5 objects.

### Build the test/prod pipelines

1. **Setup parameters** Alter, or copy the *bcrs-entities-create-ui-build-pipeline.param* updating the values for your pipeline.
2. **Create the pipeline** process the template referencing your parameter file. `oc process -f templates/business-create-ui.pipeline.json --param-file=business-create-ui.pipeline.param  | oc create -f -`
3. **Create the Jenkinsfile** this is the code that the pipeline runs. In the Jenkisnfile folder for this repo there should be 3 groovy files *deploy-dev.groovy*, *deploy-test.groovy* and *deploy-prod.groovy*. These should contain code to tag the current image of the environment to -previous and then tag the source image to the current image. Next it should verify that the new image tag triggered a new deployment. Finally, it should run any automated integration tests and report if they succeed or not.

## Updating OpenShift Environment

To update one of the OpenShift objects (such as a config map or deployment config):

1. **update the template** Alter the template of the object you are changing (business-create-ui._object_.json) and also update the template containing all the objects (business-create-ui.dc-srvc-rt-cmap-kcmap.json)
2. **update the param file** Add/delete the changes you need to the params to the `business-create-ui.dc-srvc-rt-cmap-kcmap.param` file and the `business-create-ui.`_object_`.param` file. Also update the values for each param corresponding to the environment you are updating in OpenShift
3. **update the object in OpenShift** Run the oc command over the environment you are updating `oc process -f templates/business-create-ui.`_object_`.json --param-file=business-create-ui.dc-srvc-rt-cmap-kcmap.param  | oc replace -f -`
